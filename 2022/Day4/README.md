# Day 4 - Camp Cleanup
Yesterdays work with sets really helped with this one. Learned about sets.issubset() for part 1 and
utilized sets.intersection() that we used yesterday for part 2.

## Progress
Was impressed with my progress today. I was able to get the first part done in good time and the second part only took me a few minutes.
