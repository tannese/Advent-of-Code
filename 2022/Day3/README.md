While working on the second part I Googled and found working with sets. After submitting my answer for part 2 I went back and reworked part 1 using sets as well. 

I'm sure there is a better way to slice the input line into 2 sets. I will keep looking.

[1.1.py](2022/Day3/1.1.py) is the reworked code using sets.
