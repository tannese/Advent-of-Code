First try at this challenge.

1.py was my initial script that I used to answer the chalenge. After looking over the
solutions thread on reddit I realized I put too much thought/effort into it and did stuff
that the problem didn't ask for.

2.py is my slightly slimmed down script

4.py was a good solution I found on the reddit that I wanted to keep for reference. There
were some scripts on there that were more compact but this one seemed more to my skill level.
